Welcome to the repository of the Challenge List's Queue Processor! This is a core service for the website and what keeps things seemingly real-time. This service is made *specifically* for the Challenge list, but you can use it for your own purposes if you'd like within the confines of what we (the Challenge List developers) allow you to do outside of the bounds of the current license. While we appreciate contributors and pull requests, we will not accept any requests that are not related to the Challenge List itself.

## Requirements
* Node.js v17.x or higher
* TypeScript v4.8.x or higher
* PostgreSQL v12.x or higher
* Redis v6.x or higher

## Contributions
All contributions and pull requsts are appreciated and welcome, but aspects of the queue processor are already designed with features in mind in proportion to the original Pointercrate backend. If you wish to work on new features or changes, please open an issue on our GitHub repository first to discuss the changes you wish to make and we will happily give you what is necessary to handle the addition of the feature.

### Support

All support for the queue processor is handled here on GitHub. If you have any questions, please open an issue and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

## License
